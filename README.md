## Overview

The **Yelp Portfolio Analysis** projects focus on deriving meaningful insights from Yelp data, exploring both customer reviews and business attributes. These projects aim to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Yelp datasets.
- Conduct sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions.
- Visualize patterns and trends in customer reviews and business performance.
- Provide actionable insights for businesses to enhance their services.

## Getting Started
